### Title Tag

The current title tag is:
“Nestlé Brands’ Products, Recipes and News | Made With Nestlé Canada”

**Evaluation:**
- Length is good
- Branding is clear
- Keywords are too generic
- Lacks a strong focus on search intent or unique value

**Recommendation:** Rewrite the title to include stronger keywords and emphasize benefits such as “easy recipes,” “family favorites,” or “Canadian Nestlé products.” This can improve relevance and CTR in search results.

### Meta Description

**Current description:**
"We make meals and snacks that complement busy days and warm sips to savour with slow moments. We also make nutrition solutions to help you through different life stages."

**Evaluation:**
- Length is good (approx. 200 characters)
- Does not include relevant search keywords
- Lacks clear value proposition
- Sounds generic and does not reflect the actual homepage content

**Recommendation:** Rewrite the meta description using targeted, high-intent keywords. It should reflect the purpose of the homepage (e.g. recipes, products, Nestlé Canada) and invite users to explore the content.

### H1 Header

**Observation:**
The homepage contains at least **4 different H1 tags**, all generated by banner slides. These include:
- “Essentia® Ionized alkaline water pH 9.5 (or higher)”
- “UNWRAP SOME GOOD”
- “There’s a new kid in town!”
- “Introducing NEW Drumstick Bites!”

These headings are campaign slogans or product promotions, not representative of the homepage's actual purpose.

Additionally, there is no central H1 that uses high-intent keywords like “Nestlé Recipes” or “Family Meals.”

**Recommendation:**
Use **only one H1 tag** that clearly defines the site's purpose and includes targeted keywords. Banner slides should use H2 or styled divs instead of H1 to maintain SEO structure and hierarchy.

### Visible Content & Keyword Targeting

**Observation:**
The homepage contains primarily visual content (sliders, images, and videos), with very limited visible text. There is no clear paragraph or headline that explains the site's purpose or content.

There are no visible mentions of key terms like:
- “Nestlé recipes”
- “Canadian products”
- “family meals”
- “easy cooking ideas”

**Recommendation:**
Add a visible introductory text block at the top or middle of the homepage. It should clearly describe the site’s purpose and include high-value keywords to help search engines index the content correctly and improve SEO visibility.

### Internal Linking (Homepage)

**Observation:**
Out of 182 internal links from the homepage:
- 176 have no anchor text
- 179 use generic anchor text (e.g., “Logo”, “Play Video”, or empty)
- 150 links are located in the site’s header
- No broken or redirected links were found

**SEO Impact:**
Google uses anchor text to understand content relationships. A lack of descriptive, keyword-rich anchors from the homepage limits the site’s internal SEO power and discoverability.

**Recommendation:**
- Add visible, keyword-focused anchor links to the main recipe, product, and category pages.
- Avoid using empty, image-only, or generic anchor texts in navigation.
- Diversify link placement beyond the header by including links in the body content.

### Image ALT Attributes

**Observation:**
- 36 images on the homepage are missing ALT text (≈ 23% of total images)
- 10 images are missing the ALT attribute entirely
- Several images exceed 100 KB in size

**SEO Impact:**
Missing or empty ALT text limits how search engines understand image content, reduces accessibility for screen readers, and misses opportunities to rank in Google Images.

**Recommendation:**
- Add descriptive, keyword-rich ALT text to all relevant images
- Ensure each image has an ALT attribute, even if it's decorative (use `alt=""` if appropriate)
- Compress or resize large images to reduce load time
