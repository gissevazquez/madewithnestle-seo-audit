## Final Thoughts

The current meta tags are mostly functional, but several can benefit from improved keyword focus, trimmed length, and stronger calls to action. By refining both `<title>` and `<meta description>` for intent, relevance, and clarity, the site will gain visibility and more user engagement from search results.
